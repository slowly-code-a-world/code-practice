Oh, no! You have just completed a lengthy document when you have an unfor-
tunate Find/Replace mishap. You have accidentally removed all spaces, punc-
tuation, and capitalization in the document. A sentence like "I reset the
computer. It still didn't boot!"would become"iresetthecomput-
eritstilldidntboot". You figure that you can add back in the punctation and
capitalization later, once you get the individual words properly separated. Most
of the words will be in a dictionary, but some strings, like proper names, will not.
Given a dictionary (a list of words), design an algorithm to find the optimal way
of "unconcatenating"a sequence of words. In this case, "optimal" is defined to be
the parsing which minimizes the number of unrecognized sequences of char-
acters.
For example, the string "jesslookedjustliketimherbrother" would be
optimally parsed as "JESS looked just like TIM her brother". This
parsing has seven unrecognized characters, which we have capitalized for clarity.
